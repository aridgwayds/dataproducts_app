# Description:

This repository contains the R files for the final project in the Coursera Data Products course. 

See the Description Link above for details on the assignment. As stated in the course project instructions:

	"The goal of your project is to create a Shiny application which includes an input widget, ui input used in server.r code, and show reactive output. The application must be deployed on Rstudio's server."
	
	"Second goal is to create a presentation for the application and publish it as a Slidify or Rstudio Presenter presentation."


# Shiny.r App

The project in this repository is for an interactive Shiny.r web application which provides a way to view significant weather events which occurred in the United States during 2019. The application presents the frequency of events using a Word Cloud along with a reference data table. The required files are:

* global.r
* ui.r
* server.r

The application can be accessed here: https://aridgwayds.shinyapps.io/Weather_Events_Project
